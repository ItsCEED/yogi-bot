# Installation scripts
Ansible has been defined as the better tool to help you installing servers that you'll need to make yogi works.
I won't explain how ansible works and but I strongly encourage you to read the documentation if you have any questions about the tool. It is basically creating scripts from recipies and apply them to a list of servers you'll provide.
